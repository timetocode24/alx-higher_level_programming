This is a directory for the **Python - Hello, world** project's tasks, it covers the history of *_Python Programming Language_*, *Compilation*, *Python intrepreter* and *Python basics*
## Learning objectives
- Why Python programming is awesome

- Who is Guido van Rossum
- Where does the name ‘Python’ come from

#### Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.
  * Prototype: `int check_cycle(listint_t *list);`
  * Return: `0` if there is no cycle, `1` if there is a cycle
